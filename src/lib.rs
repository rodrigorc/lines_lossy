/// Like `BufRead::lines` but lossy.
///
/// This crate provices an extension trait [`LinesLossyExt`], blanketly implemented for any type
/// that implements `BufRead`. It has a single member function [`LinesLossyExt::lines_lossy`], that
/// works just like `BufRead::lines` except that in presence of invalid UTF-8 data, it returns a
/// lossy representation of that string, with `ï¿½` replacing invalid characters, just like
/// `String::from_utf8_lossy` does.
///
/// # When to use `lines_lossy`
/// You'll want to use `lines_lossy` to read the lines of a UTF-8 encoded text file that you
/// suspect may have non UTF-8 byte sequences embedded, but that you want to process the correct
/// text anyway.
///
/// The obvious example is a log file: it should be UTF-8 encoded, but it lives for a long time,
/// it may be corrupted, it may dump text read from untrusted sources... You don't want to
/// discard lines just because they are not UTF-8 valid, just read what you can. Any other
/// human-readable text file might also fit this use-case.
///
/// Other example would be files using a computer language that uses ASCII only caracters, but that
/// may have human readable comments using an uspecified encoding. Since that encoding may be
/// anything you will not be able to succesfully decode them, but they are comments and maybe can
/// be discarded. This use-case would include languages such as assembly, g-code, dxf, nmea...
///
/// # When not to use `lines_lossy`
/// You should not use this crate to read text files that should always have correct UTF-8 lines,
/// such as configuration files or API replies. If you have such a file with a non UTF-8 byte
/// sequence, then the responsible thing to do is probably to discard the whole file; or the whole
/// line if the format is line oriented.
